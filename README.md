# HNSW
My own implementation of HNSW (Hierarchical navigable small world) for Approximate Nearest Neighbor(ANN) search according to the paper ["Efficient and Robust Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs" by Yu. A. Malkov and D. A. Yashunin.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320).

Current implementation is faulty, I am working on fixing it, seems like balancing does not work properly yet.

## Usage
Usage examples can be found in `main.cpp` file, which is also a benchmark for the algorithm.
